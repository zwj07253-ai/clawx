## 🔒 Access Control

### DM (Direct Message) Access

**Default**: `dmPolicy: "pairing"` — unrecognized users will receive a pairing code.

#### Approve Pairing

```shell
openclaw pairing list wecom            # View pending pairing requests
openclaw pairing approve wecom <CODE>  # Approve a pairing request
```

#### Allowlist Mode

Configure allowed user IDs via `channels.wecom.allowFrom`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "wecom": {
      "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
      "allowFrom": ["user_id_1", "user_id_2"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Open Mode

Set `dmPolicy: "open"` to allow all users to send direct messages without approval.

#### Disabled Mode

Set `dmPolicy: "disabled"` to completely block all direct messages.

### Group Access

#### Group Policy (`channels.wecom.groupPolicy`)

- `"open"` — Allow messages from all groups (default)
- `"allowlist"` — Only allow groups listed in `groupAllowFrom`
- `"disabled"` — Disable all group messages

### Group Configuration Examples

#### Allow All Groups (Default Behavior)

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "wecom": {
      "groupPolicy": "open"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Allow Only Specific Groups

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "wecom": {
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "groupAllowFrom": ["group_id_1", "group_id_2"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Allow Only Specific Senders Within a Group (Sender Allowlist)

In addition to the group allowlist, you can restrict which members within a group are allowed to interact with the bot. Only messages from users listed in `groups.<chatId>.allowFrom` will be processed; messages from other members will be silently ignored. This is a sender-level allowlist that applies to **all messages**.

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "wecom": {
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "groupAllowFrom": ["group_id_1"],
      "groups": {
        "group_id_1": {
          "allowFrom": ["user_id_1", "user_id_2"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
