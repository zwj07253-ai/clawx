 * Typing indicator management for the Feishu/Lark channel plugin.

 * Feishu does not expose a first-class "typing indicator" API the way
 * some other messaging platforms do. Instead, this module simulates a
 * typing state by adding a recognisable emoji reaction (the "Typing"
 * emoji) to the user's message while the bot is processing, and
 * removing it once the response is ready.
 *
 * This provides a lightweight visual cue that the bot has acknowledged
 * the message and is working on a reply.
